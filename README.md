# CMPM163Homework1

This project is to help people get used to using Unity. In this project I learned how to add models, lights, materials, and shaders. The process I used the most was changing the coding of the shader a bit and adding it to the material, which changes how the onject looks by changing the sliders. 

Part 1 has three objects that rotate and has 3 lights that also move. The first plane has a texture, rotation, and two lights on it that bounce. The second cube also rotates but it has a phong shader. The circle also rotates and has a vertex displacement shader. 

Part 2 has two objects that both has the same effect of an image processing shader. It pulls the image up, down, left, and right by using the arrow buttons. 

Part 3 is similar to the game of life shader. I changed the color and slightly changed the values so it makes it react differently.
